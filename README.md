This branch contains designing tools with web-based UI. 

I plan to make a visualized 3D grapher to layout scenes for ray tracing, with real-time rendering system. 

The 3D grapher is to include basic shapes (triangles and parallelograms, circles, spheres, rings, polyhedrons... ), and I decide to make a large spline surface system. 

This is my first time to make UI. I decide to try a 2D grapher first, then it would be easier for me to make the 3D grapher. 

If you have any advises, please comment me at Github Issues. Thank you!
