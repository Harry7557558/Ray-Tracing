Ray-tracing, without using any third-party libraries. <br/>
A image of this large requires about 20 seconds and 20M memories. (4 threads, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz, Windows 10 home)

Core sources are in "Object.h", other source files are debugging. <br/>
Support intersection of vector planes, triangles, parallelograms, spheres, circles, and cylinders. <br/>
Temporary don't support diffuse reflection and refraction.

The first and the second consists of over 400,000 triangles. Each needs 16-20s but more than 1.6G memories; (Since mutex lock don't work well in this kind of situation, I need to copy data of all 400,000 objects for 4 threads)

The third and fourth image are vector. Each requires less than 2 seconds and less than 2M memories; 

The last one is complex Î“ function. Some details were not very well, because my computer don't have that much memories for that much triangles.  :-(

I had done a lot of optimization in CPU usage. I used to spent more than 20 minutes to render an object consists of 6000 triangles. Now, I can do it in 5 seconds. But it requires 4 times of memory.
