When this CPT start I have just learned coding for 3 months. I spent a total of 120 hours on it. (40h math on paper + 20h coding + 50h debugging + 10h modelling/rendering)

Today, looking back, my source was quite ugly and stupid. Now I could remake this CPT within a weekend with 10 times higher rendering speed.
